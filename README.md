# Implemented_Unstructured_P2P_networks
Implemented search algorithm for unstructured peer to peer networks comprising of 20-80 nodes ( using GENI portal ), that allowed peer to share content among each other using UDP communication protocol, and measured the performance characteristics like hops, latency, per query cost, delay etc. over different scales of the network.
